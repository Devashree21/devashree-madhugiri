      <description>The inner workings of a Machine Learning model are challenging to understand. Explainable AI aims to create a transparency by explaining how the machine learning model arrived at the decision. There are few interesting Explainable AI libraries for Python that present these details within an interactive dashboard. In this blog article, I have explored the ExplainableDashboard library with a simple regression model. This article has been published on the &amp;lsquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rsquo; blog.</description>

      <description>Dashboards are important to convey all the relevant information altogether. There are some interesting dashboarding libraries in Python. Bokeh is a powerful tool but the coding for visualization takes some effort for a newbie. Hence, in this blog post, I build a beginner-friendly dashboard step-by-step using &amp;lsquo;Bokeh-Pandas&amp;rsquo; - a Bokeh based tool with Front-end Pandas support.
