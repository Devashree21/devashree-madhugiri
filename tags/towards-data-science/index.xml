      <description>Data visualization allows data science professionals to derive meaningful insights from data. Several software packages are available to visualize data and build meaningful dashboards. While building visualizations in Python, there are libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, etc., and ggplot2, lattice when using R. In this article, I share a step by step approach to build interactive plots in R using the rbokeh library.

      <description>The inner workings of a Machine Learning model are challenging to understand. Explainable AI aims to create a transparency by explaining how the machine learning model arrived at the decision. There are few interesting Explainable AI libraries for Python that present these details within an interactive dashboard. In this blog article, I have explored the ExplainableDashboard library with a simple regression model.
