      <description>AutoML automates the process of machine learning for challenging real-world problems. Multiple AutoML tools are available for building better machine learning models. These tools allow building of complex machine learning models with just a few lines of code.In this article, I explore AutoML library &amp;ldquo;Auto-Sklearn&amp;rdquo; for its model building and algorithm selection capabilities with classification and regression examples. Auto-Sklearn library is based on the popular sklearn library for machine learning.</description>

      <description>Big data handling is a challenge with standard hardware when we work on machine learning or deep learning models. To address this issue, we can avail the benefits of cloud computing. There are different cloud services available for data science and machine learning. This comprehensive guide covers the basics of cloud computing for machine learning. It also provides information on selection of a suitable cloud services provider for building machine learning models.</description>

      <description>Most of the Machine Learning processes like data cleaning, formatting and organization, algorithm selection, model building and optimization, etc. are quite tedious and time consuming. Automating such processes allows data scientists more time to focus on interpreting the results and improving the models to solve real-world issues. This automation of ML processes is achieved by the use of AutoML tools. Through this blog, I share information on several AutoML tools available and explore one of the tools &amp;ldquo;AutoGluon&amp;rdquo; for classification and regression examples.</description>

      <description>The inner workings of a Machine Learning model are challenging to understand. Explainable AI aims to create a transparency by explaining how the machine learning model arrived at the decision. There are few interesting Explainable AI libraries for Python that present these details within an interactive dashboard. In this blog article, I have explored the ExplainableDashboard library with a simple regression model. This article has been published on the &amp;lsquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rsquo; blog.</description>

      <description>In this article, I share the details of how I built &amp;amp; evaluated a machine learning model for predicting stroke. The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and the model built predicts whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
