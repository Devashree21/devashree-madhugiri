      <description>The inner workings of a Machine Learning model are challenging to understand. Explainable AI aims to create a transparency by explaining how the machine learning model arrived at the decision. There are few interesting Explainable AI libraries for Python that present these details within an interactive dashboard. In this blog article, I have explored the ExplainableDashboard library with a simple regression model. This article has been published on the &amp;lsquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rsquo; blog.</description>

      <description>In this article, I share the details of how I built &amp;amp; evaluated a machine learning model for predicting stroke. The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and the model built predicts whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
