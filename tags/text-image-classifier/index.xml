      <description>Vast amount of digital information is available to businesses these days. Handling data in different formats such as .csv,.txt,.pdf, etc. manually is tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. Also, as these files cannot be directly edited, it is required to have a tool that can read the content from the image and extract it for further processing. Such tools are based on OCR or Optical Character Recognition. In this article, I share a step-by-step approach to build a model for text extraction from an image using Keras-OCR library.</description>
