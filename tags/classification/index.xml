      <description>AutoML automates the process of machine learning for challenging real-world problems. Multiple AutoML tools are available for building better machine learning models. These tools allow building of complex machine learning models with just a few lines of code.In this article, I explore AutoML library &amp;ldquo;Auto-Sklearn&amp;rdquo; for its model building and algorithm selection capabilities with classification and regression examples. Auto-Sklearn library is based on the popular sklearn library for machine learning.</description>

      <description>Image classification has a wide range of applications in different industries. Neural Networks are a better choice for image based problems. In this blog article, I explore the CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN with a step-by-step tutorial. This dataset contains 6000 images and 10 labeled categories and is good starter dataset for Deep Learning.

      <description>In this article, I share the details of how I built &amp;amp; evaluated a machine learning model for predicting stroke. The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and the model built predicts whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
