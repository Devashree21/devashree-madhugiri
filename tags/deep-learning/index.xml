      <description>Deep Neural Networks consists of multiple hidden layers. Although it is possible to visualize the structure of the deep learning model in Keras as a flowchart, there are some Python libraries which allow graphical representation of the neural networks for presentation purposes. In this article, I explore one such visualizaion library called &amp;ldquo;Visualkeras&amp;rdquo; for plotting the structure of neural networks.

      <description>Image classification has a wide range of applications in different industries. Neural Networks are a better choice for image based problems. In this blog article, I explore the CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN with a step-by-step tutorial. This dataset contains 6000 images and 10 labeled categories and is good starter dataset for Deep Learning.
