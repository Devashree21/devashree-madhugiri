      <description>Food images seem to trend on social media platforms. Yummy food images speak a lot about the food choices and combinations in different cultures. The searches for food images are quite common on google images or Instagram. This makes us wonder, how does a search engine know if the image is a cake or a donut? The answer is image tags. These tags are image annotations which could either be manually added or using an AI tool like a trained image classifier.</description>

      <description>AutoML assist in automating all time consuming tasks in machine learning projects. Tasks like setting up the model, data preprocessing, pipeline creation and more can be automated with minimal amount of code. There are several AutoML tools available which aim to speed up the ML processes. In this article, I share a tutorial on classification and regression task using an AutoML tool &amp;lsquo;AutoKeras&amp;rsquo;.

      <description>Image Augmentation helps to create additional data from the existing dataset. CNNs can be trained better with additional data for image classification tasks. There are several open-source Python packages for image data augmentation. In this article, I explore some commonly used image augmentation techniques using 3 Python libraries - Imgaug, Albumentations and Solt.

      <description>Data Augmentation allows to extend the existing actual data. Deep Learning models can benefit from this process. Image, Audio, Video and Text formats can be augmented using open-source Python libraries. In this article, I share different image augmentation techniques using AugLy, an augmentation library from Facebook.

      <description>Deep Neural Networks consists of multiple hidden layers. Although it is possible to visualize the structure of the deep learning model in Keras as a flowchart, there are some Python libraries which allow graphical representation of the neural networks for presentation purposes. In this article, I explore one such visualizaion library called &amp;ldquo;Visualkeras&amp;rdquo; for plotting the structure of neural networks.

      <description>Image classification has a wide range of applications in different industries. Neural Networks are a better choice for image based problems. In this blog article, I explore the CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN with a step-by-step tutorial. This dataset contains 6000 images and 10 labeled categories and is good starter dataset for Deep Learning.
