      <description>Image classification has a wide range of applications in different industries. Neural Networks are a better choice for image based problems. In this blog article, I explore the CIFAR-10 dataset using CNN with a step-by-step tutorial. This dataset contains 6000 images and 10 labeled categories and is good starter dataset for Deep Learning.

      <description>In this article, I share the details of how I built &amp;amp; evaluated a machine learning model for predicting stroke. The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and the model built predicts whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
