      <description>Deep Neural Networks consists of multiple hidden layers. Although it is possible to visualize the structure of the deep learning model in Keras as a flowchart, there are some Python libraries which allow graphical representation of the neural networks for presentation purposes. In this article, I explore one such visualizaion library called &amp;ldquo;Visualkeras&amp;rdquo; for plotting the structure of neural networks.
