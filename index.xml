      <description>There are various EDA libraries available in Python. Seaborn is one such popular library which caters to all the data visualization requirements in an EDA. In this blog post, I explore Data Visualization using another powerful library &amp;lsquo;Altair&amp;rsquo; and compare it with Seaborn library on a plot-by-plot basis.

      <description>The inner workings of a Machine Learning model are challenging to understand. Explainable AI aims to create a transparency by explaining how the machine learning model arrived at the decision. There are few interesting Explainable AI libraries for Python that present these details within an interactive dashboard. In this blog article, I have explored the ExplainableDashboard library with a simple regression model. This article has been published on the &amp;lsquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rsquo; blog.</description>

      <description>Dashboards are important to convey all the relevant information altogether. There are some interesting dashboarding libraries in Python. Bokeh is a powerful tool but the coding for visualization takes some effort for a newbie. Hence, in this blog post, I build a beginner-friendly dashboard step-by-step using &amp;lsquo;Bokeh-Pandas&amp;rsquo; - a Bokeh based tool with Front-end Pandas support.

      <description>EDA is a time consuming process and requires some experience when it comes to presenting the insights from a given dataset. It is quite likely that any beginner would get overwhelmed with the existing array of Data Visualization libraries. Hence, AutoEDA is a good solution when you need a quick overview of the chosen dataset. In this blog post, I have shared a beginner-friendly tutorial of 3 important AutoEDA libraries - PandasProfiling, Sweetviz and AutoViz.</description>

      <description>In this article, I share the details of how I built &amp;amp; evaluated a machine learning model for predicting stroke. The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle and the model built predicts whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
